1  Introduction 
Facial recognition, as a key technology in the field of computer vision, has made significant progress in recent years. The emergence of deep learning has greatly promoted the development of facial recognition technology, significantly improving its accuracy and generalization ability. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the application of deep learning in facial recognition.
2  Fundamentals of Deep Learning 
2.1 Overview
Deep learning is a machine learning method based on artificial neural networks, which learns complex patterns and features in data through multiple layers of nonlinear transformations. Deep learning has achieved great success in fields such as image processing, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
2.2 Neural Network Architecture
1. Basic Architecture
1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): It is commonly used for image recognition and has the characteristics of local connections and shared weights, which can effectively extract image features.
2. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): suitable for processing sequence data, such as speech and text, and capable of capturing temporal information in the data.
3. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU): They are improved versions of RNN, capable of better handling long-term dependencies.
2. Advanced architecture
1. AlexNet: An early deep learning architecture with groundbreaking significance.
2. GoogleNet: Based on the innovative inception module, it improves the performance of the network.
3. ResNet: By introducing residual connections, it solves the problem of gradient vanishing in deep network training.
4. VGGNet: It has a simple architecture and good performance.
2.3 Training Methods
Deep learning training usually employs the backpropagation algorithm to minimize the loss function by adjusting the weights of the network. In addition, there are some optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, etc., used to improve training efficiency.

3.2 Feature extraction
1. CNN-based method
1. Directly use CNN to extract face features, and learn the abstract features of the face through multiple convolution and pooling operations.
2. Some studies have also adopted a multi-branch CNN architecture to extract features at different levels.
2. GAN-based method
1. GAN can be used to generate new face samples to expand the training data and enhance the generalization ability of the model.
2. It can also be used for data augmentation to improve the model's robustness to noise and variations.
3.3 Loss Function
1. Euclidean distance loss
1. Measuring the difference by calculating the Euclidean distance between samples is commonly used in metric learning.
2. Angle / Cosine Marginal Loss
1. The aim is to make the learned features have a larger margin in angular or cosine space, thereby improving the separability of the features.
3. Softmax loss and its variants
1. Common softmax losses, such as cross-entropy loss, improve model performance by encouraging feature separability.
2. Variants such as L2-softmax loss and NormFace further improve the performance of the model by normalizing features or adjusting the form. of the loss function.
3.4 Face Recognition Model
1. Traditional model
1. Eigenfaces and Fisherfaces are early face recognition methods based on the idea of linear subspace learning.
2. Feature descriptors such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) are also used in face recognition.
2. Deep learning model
1. The DeepID series models are early deep learning face recognition models that improve recognition accuracy by learning deep features of faces.
2. FaceNet learns discriminative face feature representations by using a triplet loss function.
3. Models such as SphereFace, CosFace, and ArcFace have further improved the performance of face recognition by introducing angular or cosine margin losses.
4 Conclusion  
Deep learning has made remarkable progress in the field of face recognition, but still faces some challenges, such as data bias, data noise, and the interpretability of models. Future research directions include developing more effective data augmentation methods, exploring new network architectures and loss functions, and improving the robustness and generalization ability of models. 
In conclusion, deep learning has brought great progress to face recognition technology, but continuous research and innovation are still needed to solve existing problems and promote the development of this field.
